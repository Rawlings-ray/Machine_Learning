# Machine Learning Algorithms Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms Repository! This repository contains implementations and explanations of various machine learning algorithms.

## Algorithms

### 1. Linear Regression

Linear regression is a fundamental algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It aims to find the best-fitting straight line through the data points.

### 2. Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a binary classification algorithm used to model the probability of a binary outcome. It estimates the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category.

### 3. Decision Trees

Decision trees are versatile algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. They partition the feature space into a set of disjoint regions and make predictions based on the majority class or average target value within each region.

### 4. Random Forest

Random Forest is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive performance and reduce overfitting. It builds a multitude of decision trees and merges their predictions to make more accurate and stable predictions.

### 5. Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Support Vector Machines are powerful supervised learning algorithms used for classification and regression tasks. They find the hyperplane that best separates classes in the feature space, maximizing the margin between classes.

### 6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors is a simple yet effective algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It predicts the class or value of a data point by averaging the values of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.


### 7. K-Means Clustering

K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for clustering tasks. It partitions the data into k clusters based on similarity, where each cluster is represented by its centroid.
